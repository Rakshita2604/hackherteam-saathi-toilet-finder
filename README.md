## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Choice of Theme - Creating solutions for women health, safety and upliftment of vulnerable section

Access to sanitation facilities while travelling is one of the biggest challenges faced by women in developing countries. Without knowing how and where to get clean public washrooms, we often have to compromise our health and hygiene, exposing ourselves to UTIs and what not. 

It is even worse when we are on our periods and have no idea if the nearest toilet will have running water and a pad disposer or sanitary dustbin available. 

## OUR SOLUTION 

**We Divided the Problem into Two Parts -**

1. Women need access to clean hygienic washrooms available nearby.
2. Private establishment owners need to be incentivised to keep their washrooms clean and hygienic.

**And Narrowed it Down to One Solution**

Giving people information about the nearest available toilets and their condition so that travelling customer traffic gets concentrated to establishments with cleaner toilets by default.

**Product  - TOILET FINDER WEBSITE "SAATHI"**

We will build a web application where users can access their nearest available washrooms and see the cleanliness and hygiene rating of them along with previous user recommendations. This will help users make an uniformed choice about where to to.

Establishments like restaurants, hotels and shops can register their washrooms in our database by providing information including location and real-time pictures. Washrooms that maintain a very high user rating will be featured in the top of our searches and the corresponding establishments will hence attract more travelling customers, thus incentivisng them for maintaining cleanliness. Establishmenst that fail to maintain a threshhold rating will be dropped off our list.

## For the User

**Step 1** - Locate Washrooms near you and compare their ratings.

**Step 2** - Choose the washroom you want to use and tind directions to the location of your choice.

**Step 3** - Rate the service before you leave.


## For SAATHI Partners

**Step 1** - Register yourself with us.

**Step 2** - Provide your location, contact details and latest images of the washroom facilities (images can also be uploaded in reviews by users).

**Step 3** - Maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of your establishment to keep attracting more customers.
